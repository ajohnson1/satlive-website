### Overview

Combinatorial Reconfiguration is a novel algorithmic concept that provides 
mathematical models and analysis for "transformations over state spaces." 
Its appearance ranges from theory to applications. However, its technical 
achievements are hard to access. Thus, it is required to found a common 
infrastructure for utilizing and applying the algorithmic technology of 
combinatorial reconfiguration. 
See this website 
(https://core.dais.is.tohoku.ac.jp/en/project/project_summary/) for more 
backgrounds.

The 2nd Combinatorial Reconfiguration Challenge (CoRe Challenge 2023) is a 
competition aiming for practically exploring the combinatorial 
reconfiguration.

This 2nd challenge continues to target the Independent Set Reconfiguration (ISR) 
problem.
The ISR problem is one of the most well-studied reconfiguration problems. 
Theoretically, the problem is PSPACE-complete, which implies that there 
exist instances such that even a shortest reconfiguration sequence requires 
a super polynomial steps. Theoretical results and their references can be 
found in a survey by N. Nishimura (https://doi.org/10.3390/a11040052).
